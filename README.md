# Java Web Services

This repository is accompanies Bharath Thippireddy's Udemy course *Java Web Services* with JAX-RS (REST) and JAX-WS (SOAP) leveraging the very powerful Apache CXF Web Services engine.

Modern web services supporting time-tested SOAP Services and Clients and lightweight REST webservices are presented in the course. Bharath challenges the learner with quizzes on key concepts and assignments throughout the course.

Leveraging Spring Boot as a starting place, the learner is shown how web services with Apache CXF can be built on current LTS OpenJDKs, including versions 8, 11, and 15.
